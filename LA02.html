		<h1> Row Echelon Forms</h1>
		<p> Using row reduction techniques, matricies can be reduced to what is defined as <b>row echelon form</b>. For a matrix to be in row echelon form, three total conditions must be met. These three conditions are: </p> 
		<p> 1) Any leading entry is in a column right of the leading entry in the row above <br>
	            2) In any given column with a leading entry, the entries below the leading entry are 0 <br>
		    3) All rows consisting of only zero are below any nonzero rows  </p>	
		<p> A <b>zero</b> row is a row in a matrix consisting of only zeros. A <b>nonzero</b> row is a row in the matrix that has at least one entry that is not zero. A <b>leading entry </b> is the first entry in a row. </p>
		<pre> | 0   0   0 |  <-- A zero row                        </pre>
		<pre> | 0   0   1 |  <-- A nonzero row                     </pre>	
		<p> A few examples of matricies in row echelon form are: </p>	
		<pre>  | 4   1   4 |        | 1   2   3   5 |                    </pre>
		<pre>  | 0   2   3 |        | 0   9   2   4 |                    </pre>
		<pre>  | 0   0   1 |        | 0   0   0   1 |                    </pre>		
		<pre>  | 0   0   0 |        | 0   0   0   0 |                    </pre>		
		<p> Because these above matricies satisfy all three rules, they are in <b> row echelon form </b>. A couple of matricies that are <b>NOT</b> in row echelon form are: </p>	
		<pre> | 4   1   4 |         | 1   2   3   5 |                    </pre>
		<pre> | 0   2   3 |         | 0   1   2   4 |                    </pre>
		<pre> | 1   0   1 |         | 0   1   1   3 |                    </pre>		
		<pre> | 0   0   0 |         | 0   0   0   1 |                    </pre>	
		<p> The first matrix is not in row echelon form because it violates rule 2 (There is an entry below a leading entry that is nonzero). The second matrix is not in row echelon form because it violates rule 1 (The leading entry in row 3 is not in a column right of the leading entry in the row above).
		<h2> Reduced Row Echelon Form</h2>
		<p> Reduced row echelon form is very similar to row echelon form, with two major differences. These are: </p>
		<p> 1) Each leading entry in a row must be 1 (as opposed to normal echelon form, where the leading entry can be any number) <br>
		    2) Each row with a leading entry must have zeros <b>above</b> in addition to having zeros below </p>
		<p> A couple of matricies in reduced row echelon form are: </p>
		<pre>  | 1   0   0 |        | 1   0   0   0 |                    </pre>
		<pre>  | 0   1   0 |        | 0   1   6   0 |                    </pre>
		<pre>  | 0   0   1 |        | 0   0   0   1 |                    </pre>		
		<pre>  | 0   0   0 |        | 0   0   0   0 |                    </pre>	
		<p> These matricies are in reduced row echelon form because each leading entry is a one, and since each leading one has zeros above and below it. Some matricies not in reduced row echelon form are:  </p>
		<pre>  | 1   0   5 |        | 1   0   0   0 |                    </pre>
		<pre>  | 0   1   0 |        | 0   3   6   0 |                    </pre>
		<pre>  | 0   0   1 |        | 0   0   0   1 |                    </pre>		
		<pre>  | 0   0   0 |        | 0   0   0   0 |                    </pre>	
		<p> The first matrix is not in reduced row echelon form because each leading one does not have all zeros above and below it. The second matrix is not in reduced row echelon form because each leading entry is not a one. Note however that both of these matricies are in row echelon form, just not reduced row echelon form. </p>
